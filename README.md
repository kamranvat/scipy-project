# Analyzing the performance of different policies in a Gymnasium Reinforcement Learning environment
Final project for the Scientific Python course at the University of Osnabr√ºck, summer semester of 2023

## Goal of the project:
We will implement a few different agents in a gym environment, like the cartpole environment or a similar one. 
Different policies should show different performance data. 
We will track this data, for example with tensorboard, then perform some analysis on it to determine which one performed best.

## Steps required:
- Find a suitable pre-made environment
- Find suitable algorithms and implementations (e.g. stable baselines 3)
- Record performance 
- Compare the performances
- Visualize the data
- Interpret the results

## Libraries:
- Gymnasium (maintained gym fork)
- Dependencies of stable baseline algorithm implementations (or similar pre-built reinforcement learning algorithms), such as (but not limited to) tensorflow.
seaborn
- numpy
